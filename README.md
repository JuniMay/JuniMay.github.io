# A Minimal Blog

This is a very simple blog made with GPT-4o using next.js and tailwindcss.

Currently work in progress.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build # pack the static files to `out` directory
serve -s out
```

## About

I am not familiar with web development, so most tasks are done by GPT-4o. I am trying to learn more
about web development by building this blog.
